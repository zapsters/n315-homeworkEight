## Purpose

This should be a Firebase project so make sure you create your project first and then start coding. You will be building out the rest of your Jungle cook and making it fully functional. I also need you to understand how to read and create data.

## Instructions

For this homework assignment, you will make the Jungle Cook website fully functional. This site must be fully responsive for desktops and tablets, 1024Ã—768, and must be a fully working CRUD application. Assets for this project can be found in Files > Jungle Cook. In this folder, you will find everything you need.

- You must have user feedback i.e. have alerts showing when loading data or something happens so the user knows something is wrong.
- You will be using JSON for the data for this project. This will be a JSON file from a local folder. Links to an external site.
- Points will be taken off for not having your site responsive and not having user feedback. Also, if you don't have a fully functioning CRUD application, you will have points deducted.
- For the CRUD you must be able to create a recipe, delete the recipe, display all recipes and update a recipe. If you can not do any of that, then this is not a CRUD application.
- Make sure you get your styling done first. Then your functionality.
- Have your project on Github with a Full README file description of your project. I want full details about what the application does and how it works.
- Deploy this to Web4 and to Github as well. Remember to add to your Readme file and put the link to Firebase link inside the Readme file.
